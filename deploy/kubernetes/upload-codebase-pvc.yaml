## Deprecated: upload-codebase-pvc
##
## This file previously defined a separate PVC for upload-service metadata.
## The architecture now shares a single metadata volume (code-metadata-pvc)
## across upload-service and indexers, so this PVC is intentionally removed.
##
## Left as a stub to avoid accidental kubectl apply of an unused resource.
